It has no external dependencies. To install,\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gragas/simpletcp`\r\n2. Install the package: `python3 setup.py install`\r\n\r\n### Quick Start\r\n\r\nsimpleTCP just requires that you specify:\r\n\r\n* the mode (local or public) of your server\r\n* the port of your server\r\n* what happens when your server receives data\r\n\r\nFor example, here's an echo server:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom simpletcp.tcpserver import TCPServer\r\n\r\ndef echo(queue, data):\r\n    queue.put(data)\r\n\r\nserver = TCPServer(\"localhost\", 5000, echo)\r\nserver.run()\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Callback functions\r\n\r\n`echo` is the server's callback function. This function is called whenever the server receives data.\r\n\r\nCallback functions should take two arguments:\r\n\r\n1. `queue`: This is a `queue.Queue` object. Any data put into this queue will be asynchronously sent back to the socket it was received from. In this case, our server echoes all data it receives, so we just put all received data right back into this queue with `queue.put(data)`.\r\n2. `data`: This is the data that the server received. It is a string of bytes. Its type is `bytes`.\r\n\r\n#### The `TCPServer` itself\r\n\r\nThe `TCPServer` constructor takes three arguments:\r\n\r\n1. The `mode`. There are two valid `modes`: `\"localhost\"` and `\"public\"`. They are aptly named --- `\"localhost\"` means run the server on `127.0.0.1`. Therefore, the server is only visible on the machine on which it is running. `\"public\"` means run the server on `0.0.0.0` --- make it visible to anything that can see the machine on which it is running.\r\n2. The port. For development, pick a high (four-digit) number.\r\n3. The callback function. This function is called whenever the server receives data.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nExamples can be found in the `/examples` folder.\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nApache Version 2. It looks the coolest.\r\n\r\n### Original Author and Maintainer\r\n\r\nThomas Fischer\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
